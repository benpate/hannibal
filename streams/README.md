## Hannibal / Streams

This package implements the [ActivityStreams 2.0](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitystreams-core/) 
specifications in Hannibal.  Specifically, it provides an overly simplistic view of JSON-LD 
documents, contexts, and the various types of ActivityStreams collections.

This is not a rigorous implementation of JSON-LD.  Instead, it is an easy way to navigate 
well-formatted JSON-LD documents and to iterate over their contents.

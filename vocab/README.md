## Hannibal / Vocab

This package contains all of the commonly used constants from the current 
[ActivityStreams Vocabulary](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitystreams-vocabulary/), 
along with a couple of simple validation functions that verify that a string 
input matches certain designated types.

This package is used by the other Hannibal packages to guarantee that we're always
using the right values in the right places.
